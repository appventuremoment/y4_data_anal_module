    "Coding has become more prominent in recent years, and now offers some of the highest paying jobs. Since this is a computer science module, every student taking this major has at least some experience in coding. Hence, I would like to seek answers to some questions pertaining to us, and could potentially change how I decide my future career path, such as what affects how much you earn working a job related to coding? Has the amount earned for coding related jobs increased over time? What proportion of people based on gender, working or otherwise, have knowledge on how to code, or in other words, is this a male-dominated field as everyone is making it out to be? What resources do people find helpful in learning how to code, and has this allowed them to further their studies in coding related majors?"

    "1. **Were respondents able to get the jobs they wanted?** I am not quite sure what I would like to do in the future yet, but there is a non-zero probability that it will be something related to coding. I would like to know how successful other people were in achieving jobs related to coding, which in turn implies how likely it is for me to get the job (that is coding related) I (might) want. I would like to analyse the proportion of respondents that became a full time developer.\n",
    "1. **Was most of the respondents male, implying more males do coding?** As mentioned, is coding predominantly done by males, as everyone implies, and how are they split based on different groups? The survey asked for a lot of personal information such as age, gender, race, income, education level, marital status, children status, disability, and army service status. I would like to analyse which groups are learning to code, and whether they are successful in life (based on the several different metrics provided).\n",
    "1. **What factors affect the job and pay of each respondent? And has it increased over the years?** As mentioned, there is a chance that I get into a job with coding required. If so, what would I (theoratically) need to do in order to maximise the the pay I get from my job. I would like to analyse several different metrics which could affect the pay, as well as see the change in the average pay for each time of job related to coding over the years to evaluate whether coding as a skill has been deemed more important over the years.\n",
    "1. **What factors affect the education level in coding related subjects?** Computer science is no easy subject. I would like to analyse what factors affect how far respondents furthered their studies in coding related subjects, to hopefully evaluate the effectiveness of different methods in learning more about computer science.\n",
